Original Maetzler Code: The original code I used as a foundation, which was taken directly from the 
"Maetzler2002" folder. mie_tetascan is the most directly relevant to simulating Mie scattering. 
The original code is heavily tailored to simulating Mie scattering. The code lends itself pretty
easily to plotting probability distributions for Mie scattering. "maetzler_mie_2002" alludes to 
improved builds of this code existing somewhere but I haven't been able to track them down.

Edited Maetzler Code: This folder contains all tweaked versions of the code I am currently running.
I am using GNU Octave so some programs might need small tweaks to run on MatLab. These tweaks range from
just adding features to turn some polar coordinates to Cartesian ones, and new programs which are 
built to simulate Monte Carlo simulations in the broadest framework I could set up.
